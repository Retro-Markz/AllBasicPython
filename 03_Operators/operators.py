# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators

# Operator Precedence

# Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

# Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)

# Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
