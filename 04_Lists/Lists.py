# List

# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# Lists are created using square brackets:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
print()

# Ordered

# When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
